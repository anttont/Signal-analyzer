# Signal-analyzer

This repository presents a signal analysis tool developed as part of a group project for a master's level course at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF). I was one of the primary programmers for this project.

The course's objective was to create a tool for a medical company that could analyze live data from medical devices, aiding doctors during surgery. The signal analyzer we developed is capable of processing live CSV data, performing real-time denoising, baseline correction, and peak detection.
